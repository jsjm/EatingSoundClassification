# Introduction
Food identification technology potentially benefits both food and media industries, and improves human-computer interaction.We assembled a food classification dataset based on 246 YouTube videos of 20 food types. This dataset is freely available on Kaggle. We suggest the grouped validation protocol as evaluation method to assess model performance. As a first approach, we applied Convolutional Neural Networks on this dataset.
